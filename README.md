The dynamic nature of urban expansion and environmental changes presents a
significant challenge for real-time monitoring and forecasting. Traditional satellite
imaging techniques are limited by temporal delays, weather conditions, and the
spatial resolution of images - restricting the effectiveness of current methodologies

in providing timely data for urban planning, environmental conservation, and disas-
ter management. Leveraging deep learning for synthetic satellite image generation

represents an approach to forecasting future urban and natural environments. We
propose a deep learning model whose framework combines convolutional (CNN)
and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks to generate synthetic satellite
images that predict a possible future iteration of the bounded location. Our model
is trained on a dataset of satellite images scraped from ArcGIS to learn the patterns
of change over time. Additionally, we use the perceived distance metric to compare
our results with the original images.
